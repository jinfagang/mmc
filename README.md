## MMC

> ⚠️⚠️ Code under heavily construction. Use at own risk.

this is a fork of original mmd C++ viewer: [link](https://github.com/jinfagang/saba.git), With the ability to render 3D models with popular backend (OpenGL, Vulkan etc.), we can make it a step further, make it render animations as well.

**MMC** add aditional animation render upon a simpler viewer. It supports 3d models format:

- pmx;
- obj;
- fbx (wip);

Supported animation format:

- vmd;
- fbx (wip);

In this way, we can make full use of resources created by MMD, such as 3d models, huge amount of vmd animations, and meanwhile we can using our own pipeline generated new animations, to driven the 3D charactor, without anyother 3D software.

Here is the default mmd render result:
